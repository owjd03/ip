## Storage and Data Persistence

### Automatic Saving

Jason automatically saves your tasks to a local file (`./data/Jason.txt`) whenever you:

- Add a new task
- Mark/unmark a task
- Delete a task
- Snooze a task

### Data Format

Tasks are stored in a pipe-delimited format:

```
T | 0 | Buy groceries | null
D | 1 | Submit report | Dec 25 2024 | null
E | 0 | Conference | Dec 20 2024-Dec 22 2024 | null
```

### Data Recovery

If the data file becomes corrupted or is deleted, Jason will start with an empty task list and create a new data file automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Error Messages

| Error Message                               | Cause                                           | Solution                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Todo cannot be empty!"                     | You entered `todo` without any description      | Add a description: `todo Buy milk`                         |
| "Give me a deadline! Include /by"           | Deadline command missing `/by` keyword          | Use proper format: `deadline Submit report /by 2024-12-25` |
| "Give me a duration! Include /from and /to" | Event command missing `/from` or `/to` keywords | Use proper format: `event Meeting /from 2pm /to 4pm`       |
| "Please specify task number"                | Command missing task number                     | Include a valid task number: `mark 1`                      |
| "Give me a valid task number"               | Task number doesn't exist or isn't valid        | Use `list` to see available task numbers                   |
| "Invalid date format"                       | Date couldn't be parsed                         | Use: `today`, `tomorrow`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`                  |

### Tips for Best Experience

1. **Use `list` frequently** to see your current tasks and their numbers
2. **Check date formats** when creating deadlines and events
3. **Use descriptive task names** to make searching easier
4. **Regular cleanup** - delete completed tasks you no longer need
5. **Use snooze wisely** - snooze tasks to dates when you can actually work on them
